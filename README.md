# Digital Engagement Platform Audit

## Overview

The DEP Audit service schedules the capture of transcript and session details initially passed to 
Nuance when Chat/Digital Assistant launched.

This service also offers a trigger endpoint which provides the mechanism to call historical data
in the event a problem occurs with the scheduled data. This endpoint takes a start and end date as parameters.
